<h1 class="display-4 fw-bold">About Me</h1>
<p class="lead text-light">
  I'm Cade Schilling, a Business Analytics and Information Systems student at the University of Iowa with a strong interest in data architecture, modeling, and cloud-based solutions. I enjoy building meaningful, scalable systems that connect data with real-world applications—from predictive modeling to infrastructure design.

  I’m a Northern Iowa native, born and raised in Mason City for 17 years before moving to neighboring Clear Lake. I began my college journey at North Iowa Area Community College, where I graduated in 2023 before transferring to the University of Iowa to pursue my passion for technology and analytics.

  I've been fortunate to gain valuable hands-on experience throughout my academic journey. Most notably, my internship at Stellar Industries gave me a solid foundation in project management, data visualization, and IT infrastructure, further fueling my desire to work at the intersection of business and technology.

  Outside the world of tech and data, I have a strong passion for fitness. I'm a certified USA Weightlifting (USAW) coach and enjoy strength training and coaching others. I also love spending time with friends—especially golfing or gaming—but nothing is more important to me than family. I make it a priority to stay connected and spend time with them as much as I can.
